## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
- cash_transactions.py runs successfully after installing plotly. There was a SettingWithCopyWarning on line 130 regarding assignment to a slice of a DataFrame. The script output is correct, but you may want to review the code for best practices to avoid this warning in the future.
