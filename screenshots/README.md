## How to Add Screenshots

When you run `python main.py`, the application will display two interactive charts in your web browser. Follow these steps to capture and add screenshots:

### 1. Monthly Dividend Chart
- **File name**: `monthly-dividends.png`
- **What to capture**: The full monthly dividend chart showing:
  - Chart title "Monthly Dividends Received"
  - X-axis with month labels (e.g., "Jul-24", "Aug-24")
  - Y-axis with dollar amounts
  - Bar columns with bold dollar amount labels on top
  - Interactive plotly controls (zoom, pan, etc.)

### 2. Weekly Dividend Chart
- **File name**: `weekly-dividends.png`
- **What to capture**: The 16-week dividend chart showing:
  - Chart title "Dividends Received Over the Last 16 Weeks"
  - X-axis with week range labels (e.g., "May-16 to May-25")
  - Y-axis with dollar amounts
  - Bar columns with bold dollar amount labels on top
  - All visible weeks in the 16-week period

### 3. Console Output
- **File name**: `console-output.png`
- **What to capture**: The terminal/console output showing:
  - Summary table with Symbol, Count, and Total Dividends
  - Clean DataFrame listing with Symbol, SettleDate, ReportDate, ExDate, Amount
  - Any status messages about data fetching and file saving

## Screenshot Guidelines

- **Format**: Save as PNG for best quality
- **Resolution**: Use high resolution (at least 1920x1080) for clarity
- **Full window**: Capture the complete chart/console window
- **Clean background**: Ensure no personal information is visible in window titles or taskbars
- **Readable text**: Make sure all text and numbers are clearly visible

## Privacy Note

⚠️ **Important**: When taking screenshots, be careful not to include:
- Account numbers or personal identifiers
- Actual dollar amounts if you prefer to keep them private
- Browser tabs or windows with sensitive information
- Desktop elements with personal information

You can blur or redact sensitive information before adding screenshots to the repository.
